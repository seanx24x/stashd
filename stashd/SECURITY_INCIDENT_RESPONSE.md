## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents in the Stashd application.

---

## Incident Categories

### 1. Critical (P0) - Immediate Response Required
- Data breach or unauthorized data access
- API key compromise
- SSL certificate compromise
- Active attack in progress
- Jailbreak/root detection in production

### 2. High (P1) - Response within 4 hours
- Multiple authentication failures
- Rate limit abuse
- Suspicious activity patterns
- Input validation bypass attempts

### 3. Medium (P2) - Response within 24 hours
- Single failed security check
- Non-critical configuration issues
- Performance degradation due to security measures

### 4. Low (P3) - Response within 1 week
- Security recommendations
- Non-urgent updates needed
- Documentation improvements

## Response Procedures

### Immediate Actions (All Incidents)

1. **Contain**
   - [ ] Identify affected systems
   - [ ] Isolate compromised components
   - [ ] Review SecurityMonitoringService logs
   - [ ] Document timeline of events

2. **Assess**
   - [ ] Determine scope of incident
   - [ ] Identify data at risk
   - [ ] Check for similar patterns
   - [ ] Review error logs

3. **Notify**
   - [ ] Alert development team
   - [ ] Prepare user communication (if needed)
   - [ ] Document incident details

## Specific Incident Responses

### API Key Compromise

**Detection:**
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Unexpected charges
- Reports of unauthorized access

**Response Steps:**
1. Immediately revoke compromised API key
2. Generate new API key
3. Update AppConfig.xcconfig
4. Deploy emergency app update
5. Monitor for further unauthorized usage
6. Review all API calls in the window of compromise
7. Notify affected users if data was accessed

**Prevention:**
- API keys stored in secure xcconfig (not in code)
- API keys never committed to git
- Rate limiting in place
- Regular API key rotation schedule

---

### Data Breach

**Detection:**
- Unauthorized data access alerts
- User reports of suspicious activity
- Database anomalies

**Response Steps:**
1. Immediately secure all data sources
2. Identify compromised data
3. Determine breach vector
4. Patch vulnerability
5. Notify affected users within 72 hours
6. Prepare incident report
7. Review all security measures
8. Implement additional safeguards

**Prevention:**
- Data encryption at rest
- SSL pinning for network traffic
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits

---

### Jailbreak Detection in Production

**Detection:**
- SecurityService.performSecurityChecks() returns failed
- SecurityMonitoringService logs jailbreak event

**Response Steps:**
1. Log security event
2. Show warning to user
3. Optionally restrict sensitive features
4. Monitor for suspicious behavior
5. Consider requiring re-authentication

**Prevention:**
- Jailbreak detection on app launch
- Regular security checks
- Code obfuscation
- Anti-tampering measures

---

### Rate Limit Abuse

**Detection:**
- Multiple rate limit hits in short period
- SecurityMonitoringService suspicious activity alert

**Response Steps:**
1. Review rate limit logs
2. Identify source of excessive requests
3. Temporarily block if malicious
4. Adjust rate limits if needed
5. Monitor for distributed attack

**Prevention:**
- Rate limiting (10 calls/min for OpenAI)
- Request throttling
- Usage monitoring
- IP-based rate limiting (future)

---

### SSL Pinning Failure

**Detection:**
- SSLPinningService validation fails
- Connection rejected

**Response Steps:**
1. Log pinning failure details
2. Check if certificate was rotated
3. Update pinned certificates if legitimate
4. Investigate if attack attempt
5. Deploy emergency update if needed

**Prevention:**
- Multiple certificates pinned
- Certificate expiration monitoring
- Backup certificate pins
