## Quick Reference

### Check Security Stats
```swift
let stats = SecurityMonitoringService.shared.getSecurityStats()
print("Events (24h): \(stats.eventsLast24Hours)")
print("High Severity: \(stats.highSeverityEvents)")
```

### Check Recent Events
```swift
let events = SecurityMonitoringService.shared.getRecentEvents(limit: 10)
events.forEach { event in
    print("\(event.type.rawValue) at \(event.timestamp)")
}
```

### Run Security Check
```swift
let result = SecurityService.shared.performSecurityChecks()
if !result.passed {
    print("Issues: \(result.issues)")
}
```
